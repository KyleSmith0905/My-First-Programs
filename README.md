# My First Programs (2 years later)
These are my (Kyle Smith) first programs I have ever developed. The code may be bad, but that was the point. When I developed these programs I had very limited prior experience with programming.

This is a repository where I can relate to my past self; if you came to see experienced programming, check other repositories on my GitHub profile.

## Tutorial Bot
I have no recollection on how this was created. But it appeared to be created from an outdated Discord.js guide.

- I cannot really say much about it besides the fact it might not be mine though.
- The guide made me love template literals. Unpopular opinion, but I cannot read them as great as concatenated strings.

## Circles Bot
I started a now-defunct community for Circle pixel art and I needed a Discord bot to keep the community unique. To help the server be unique, I would program cron jobs to run daily using a randomizer to make every day different.

- I implemented a `TODO` system index.js of everything I should work on, the only other comments are lines of code commented out.
- Looking back, the variable names no longer make sense and there is no way to interpret what the variables mean.
- I sent way too much arguments down a functions, lol!
- I was really good with file management! I ensured files only served one goal.
- I had a channel that selects two random people every day and puts them in a private channel. Very odd, but interesting!
- I had a channel for people to display pixel art. The bot scans new messages to ensure people are posting images.

## Spam Bot
My friend created a Discord server for us as a joke. To mess with the server (with the owner's permission), I created a troll Discord bot. This is kind of like how many people's first goal in programming is to make a computer virus. All members were aware of commands, nobody took the bot seriously.

- First look and noticed my file management was bad; but to be fair, this was programmed really fast.
- I had an easily-crackable password system, the commands are summoned with names like `DoLpHoNp1`. LOL!
- I had a command that every second the bot messages all users to join the server, than it messages all channels in the server to share the bot. OMG! I never intended it to be malicious or exploitive, still very funny! lol!
- I had a command that sent Shakespeare insults to random members.
- I had a command that muted someone from talking, I divert them to ask the owner of the server why despite it being my decision to mute people.
- I had a command to rapidly shift the server's layout, this made it hard to click on a channel. I remembered users started making all channels link to one and used that as a hub. lol. API spamming was against Discord policy, but I ran only for a few minutes.
- I had a command that "NUKES" people. It kicks a random user and sends them a messages saying they will be blackmailed if they don't share the bot to 10 other servers. LMAO!

## "Ame" Bot
The friend that was the owner of the spam bot discord listed above, I wanted to make his server unique with my programming help. We partnered together to build a functional bot for his server. I codenamed the bot "ame bot" off of the server's goal, the be an "American" simulator. Our partnership ended after disagreements on the server's direction[^1]. I created my own "American" simulator server and rewrote my bot in another framework, the code is [here](https://github.com/KyleSmith0905/UnicusBot). 

- The config.json file was poorly implemented, though, no one else was looking at my code so I did not care. [It never got better](https://github.com/KyleSmith0905/UnicusBot/blob/master/config.json).
- I learned to write more comments; however, I wrote overly descriptive comments. I thought that instead of reading code, I could understand my code by reading the comments instead and never have to look at my code.
- It was clear I wasn't practicing reusable code. But everything worked, so I did not mind.
- My files began to have lots of lines... Solution: I wrote screen-width bookmarks so I could quickly navigate the code.
- I had a command to control money. but it was DIFFICULT to add... I was overwhelmed by how to make a database, I had no idea where to start.
- From the troll discord, we were inspired by people's reactions when we rapidly shifted the server's layout. We built a travel system, people must travel to a "state" or Channel to talk with the community in the state.

[^1]: More specifically (since this controversy has aged), the owner of the server was trolling around in the server. It was funny, but not what I wanted to spend my programming time working towards.
